# iQmetrix Hackathon

## Team 404 Not Found - Second Place Submission

My team's submission to the 2021 iQmetrix Hackathon. We decided to make a chatbot to improve the customer service on iQmetrix website. For this project, we used Rasa Open Source to train a chatbot for a working demo. Next, we integrated the chatbot into a page made with ReactJS. By using API calls to send messages back and forth, we had a functioning chatbot.

I produced a 5 minute video showcasing our demo, along with our deck and research. This submission can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o-pj8LYeUcg0u7-zDCy8kr-014EvxBGz/view?usp=sharing).
